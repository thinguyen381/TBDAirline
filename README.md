   Notes:
          The current flow can be adjusted later because for now I want to make it easiest to implement
          A simple image was added as background
          A working version of the website has been published at http://tbdairline.azurewebsites.net
          (If you go to the website, try searh for flights, register and log in. You would be stopped at Payment page as I have not implemented it yet)
  
  Currrent flow:  
          Search for flights - Select flights - Confirm booking flights -
          Log in (if account has already existed) or Register a new account then Log in -
          Payment - Reservation confirmed
   
 *** Updated Apr 12:
All controllers are working - Search Controller,  Book Controlller,    Home Controller,     Account Controller,  Payment Controller,   Reservation Controller
 
I also added 1 more controller which is Tracking Controller. It does a simple task that receives tracking number and shows reservation's infomation.

Notes: Try the published website if you can't launch it from the code.
